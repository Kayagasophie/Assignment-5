        <p class ="cakes">One of the many things that I love about this recipe is that it is versatile as any cake could ever be! It is perfect served with a thick coating of my chocolate buttercream, my vanilla buttercream, made into cupcakes or cut into pieces and served as part of a trifle and so much more!</p>

        <p class ="cakes">Cream cakes go back many decades and are a resourceful way of replacing milk and butter with just one ingredient. <br>They are light in texture but feel heavy when lifted and can be flavored with other extracts of your liking: lemon, almond, orange, or anything you have at hand make wonderful batters.<br> Dust with powdered sugar for an easy finish, or serve with vanilla ice cream and chocolate fudge for a decadent dessert</p>
